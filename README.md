### Schedule daily email delivery

The repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs every day at 9:00 AM PT and emails you the brief automatically.

**Step 1 — Fork this repo**

Click **Fork** on `github.com/xxjaaa/daily-consumer-health-brief` to create your own copy.

**Step 2 — Add your secrets**

Go to your fork's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add each of the following:
